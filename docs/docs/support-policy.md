## Stability contract

| `.omao/profile.yaml` v1 schema | **stable** | No breaking changes before GA |
| `schemas/ontology/*.schema.json` v1 | **stable** | No breaking changes before GA |
| `schemas/harness/dsl.schema.json` v1 | **beta** | Fields may be added; no field removal |
| `bin/oma` subcommand names / exit codes | **beta** | Name changes must go through deprecation cycle |
| `oma doctor` JSON report schema v1 | **beta** | Fields may be added; no removal |
| Plugin internal skill body / prompts | **evolving** | May change between minor releases |
| `templates/` defaults | **evolving** | Frequent updates |

## Support scope

- Provided: documentation-based installation, `oma setup` / `oma doctor` bug fixes, schema violation reports.
- Not provided: production deployment support, 24x7 on-call, paid SLA, security CVE responsibility.
